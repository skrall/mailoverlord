/**
 * Matches a request whose connection really came from a configured proxy.
 *
 * <p>The identity header is only believed on such requests, so the match has to be against the
 * transport peer, not the {@code X-Forwarded-For} client: with {@code server.forward-headers-
 * strategy: framework} in front, {@code getRemoteAddr()} is already the client's address by the
 * time security runs, and an attacker controlling that header would otherwise be able to name a
 * trusted address. The innermost wrapped request is the one the socket arrived on; unwinding
 * Spring's forwarded-header wrapper to it recovers the actual peer.
 *
 * <p>Fail-fast on a CIDR that does not parse: a mistyped subnet that silently matched nothing
 * would lock everyone out, and one that silently matched everything would trust everyone.
